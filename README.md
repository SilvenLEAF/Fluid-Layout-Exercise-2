# ReactRoom
*I am learning React. This is a my React PlayGround. A collection for my React Codes.*  

HERE I test out every new thing I learn,  and practice the concepts I'm weak at. Sometimes even brush up my skills, or just code some React for fun!!'Cause I LOVE REACT!!! 



## **Important React Points:**
*React, Contexts, Hooks, Redux, Framer Motion, React Query*
